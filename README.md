# My_MeanStack_Website

This is my website built by Meanstack: nodejs+mongoose+express+angularjs+bootstrap,

run this application by excute command:     node server.js

if you want to run in local mongodb database, please change url address in /app/config/db.js

To implement Restful Api, I used express to route. You can find routes.js in /app folder and find mongodb models in app/models.

Html files are stored in public/view.

In public/js folder, you can find angular services and controllers including Anthentication, userService, FlashService, 
register and login controllers
